# Image-Recognition-Using-CNN

This project studies a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture proposed by [Zeiler and Fergus](https://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/papers/zeilerECCV2014.pdf). The CNN is implemented on Keras from scratch. Following the described methodology, image recognition is attempted on [VOC 2012](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/) data set. To keep consistency with the reference
